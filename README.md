## OBS: 

I had the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a type of dashboard for the admin user to monitor who is on pause, working but I didn't have time to continue.

I also had the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating the History menu where the user can download their points history and the admin user can download the history of all users but I didn't have time to finish it either.

The project is cool but not complete, but I tried to follow a good code and architecture standard.
